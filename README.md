# Electrophysiological data analysis

Tutorials and scripts for analyzing electrophysiological (LFP and spike train) data. 

## Tutorials

The *tutorials* folder contains jupyter notebooks meant to introduce common analyses of ephys data, emphasizing analyses frequently used by our lab, including:

- **[0_LFP_Identifying_Oscillations](https://github.com/cplab/ephys_analysis/tree/main/tutorials/0_LFP_Identifying_Oscillations.ipynb)**: Quantify LFP oscillations in the time and frequency domains
- **[1_LFP_Coherence_Directionality](https://github.com/cplab/ephys_analysis/tree/main/tutorials/1_LFP_Coherence_Directionality.ipynb)**: Between LFP signal analyses
- **[2_ST_LFP_Spike_LFP_Coupling](https://github.com/cplab/ephys_analysis/tree/main/tutorials/2_ST_LFP_Spike_LFP_Coupling.ipynb)**: Quantify how spike timing relates to LFP oscillations
- **[3_ST_SpikeTrain_Analyses](https://github.com/cplab/ephys_analysis/tree/main/tutorials/3_ST_SpikeTrain_Analyses.ipynb)**: Introduction to spike train analyses
- **[4_ST_Spike_Synchrony](https://github.com/cplab/ephys_analysis/tree/main/tutorials/4_ST_Spike_Synchrony.ipynb)**: Methods to quantify neural synchronization

## Slice Analysis

Scripts for analyzing LFP / spike data collected from electrode array recordings of brain slices, with stimulus information contained in [ceed](https://github.com/matham/ceed) files.
