# Electrophysiological data analysis

Tutorials and scripts for analyzing electrophysiological (LFP and spike train) data. 

## Tutorials

The *tutorials* folder contains jupyter notebooks meant to introduce common analyses of ephys data, emphasizing analyses frequently used by our lab, including:

- **[0_LFP_Identifying_Oscillations](https://github.com/mgm248/ephys_analysis/blob/main/tutorials/0_LFP_Identifying_Oscillations.ipynb)**: Quantify LFP oscillations in the time and frequency domains
- **1_LFP_Coherence_Directionality**: Between LFP signal analyses, including coherence and measures of directionality
- **2_ST_LFP_Spike_LFP_Coupling**: Quantify how spike timing relates to LFP oscillations
- **3_ST_SpikeTrain_Analyses:**: Introduction to spike train analyses, including analyses of rhthmicity and stimulus encoding
- **4_ST_Spike_Synchrony**: Methods to quantify neural synchronization
